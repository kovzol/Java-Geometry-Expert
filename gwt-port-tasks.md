# GWT Port Tasks for Java Geometry Expert (JGEX)

This document outlines the tasks required to port the Java Geometry Expert (JGEX) application to a web application using Google Web Toolkit (GWT). The tasks are ordered by priority and include explanations for each step.

## Current Status

The project already has some initial GWT implementation:

1. A basic GWT module configuration (JGEXWebApp.gwt.xml)
2. A simple web application entry point (JGEXWebApp.java)
3. Basic web resources (index.html, layout.css)
4. A minimal core functionality class (GExpertCore.java) that's shared between desktop and web versions
5. A simple UI interface (GExpertUI.java) for abstracting UI operations

However, the current implementation is very basic and lacks most of the functionality of the desktop application.

2. **Design**: Create a design for the web implementation, considering GWT limitations
3. **Implementation**: Implement the feature in the web application
4. **Testing**: Test the feature thoroughly in different browsers
5. **Integration**: Integrate the feature with the rest of the web application
6. **Documentation**: Document the implementation and any differences from the desktop version

## Recent Progress

### Geometry Objects Implementation (Phase 2, Point 6)

All the required geometry objects have been implemented in the web version of the application:

1. **Basic Geometry Objects**:
   - Point: Represents a point in 2D space
   - Line: Represents an infinite line
   - Circle: Represents a circle with a center and radius

2. **Complex Geometry Objects**:
   - Segment: Represents a line segment with two endpoints
   - Ray: Represents a ray with a starting point and direction
   - Polygon: Represents a polygon with multiple vertices
   - Angle: Represents an angle between two lines or three points
   - Text: Represents text annotations on the drawing

All geometry objects support:
- Proper rendering on the web canvas
- Selection and highlighting
- Manipulation (move, resize, etc.)
- Style customization (color, line width, etc.)

### Construction Tools Implementation (Phase 2, Point 7)

Several construction tools have been implemented:

1. **Basic Tools**:
   - Selection Tool: For selecting and manipulating objects
   - Point Tool: For creating points
   - Line Tool: For creating lines
   - Circle Tool: For creating circles
   - Angle Tool: For creating angles
   - Polygon Tool: For creating polygons

The Polygon Tool implementation includes:
   - Support for creating polygons with multiple points
   - Visual feedback with a preview polygon during creation
   - Closing the polygon by clicking near the first point
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Escape to cancel, Enter to finish)
   - Handling existing points (reusing them if clicked)

### Recently Implemented Construction Tools

The following construction tools have been implemented:

1. **Geometric Construction Tools**:
   - Parallel Tool: For creating lines parallel to existing lines
   - Perpendicular Tool: For creating lines perpendicular to existing lines
   - Foot Tool: For creating the foot of a perpendicular from a point to a line
   - Circle by Three Points Tool: For creating a circle through three points
   - Compass Tool: For creating a circle with a specified radius
   - Text Tool: For adding text annotations at specified locations
   - Midpoint Tool: For creating midpoints between two points

These tools follow the same pattern as the existing tools, with:
   - Preview functionality to show the result as the user interacts
   - Support for using existing points or creating new ones
   - Proper error handling for edge cases (e.g., collinear points for Circle by Three Points)
   - Consistent UI feedback through status messages and tooltips

The Text Tool has a unique interaction pattern:
   - Users click to specify the location for the text
   - A dialog appears to enter the text content
   - The text is then added at the specified location

The Midpoint Tool allows users to:
   - Select two existing points
   - Create a midpoint exactly halfway between them
   - See a preview line connecting the points and the midpoint location

### All Construction Tools Implemented ✅

All construction tools have been successfully implemented, including:

2. **Specialized Construction Tools**:
   - Intersect Tool: For finding intersections between objects
   - Mirror Tool: For creating mirror images of objects
   - Isosceles Triangle Tool: For creating isosceles triangles
   - Square Tool: For creating squares
   - Triangle Tool: For creating triangles

### Additional Tasks Identified

During the implementation, the following additional tasks were identified:

1. **Keyboard Event Handling**: The current Tool interface doesn't include keyboard event handling methods. The PolygonTool implements onKeyDown without @Override, but a more robust approach would be to extend the Tool interface to include keyboard event methods.

2. **Tool Icons**: The current implementation uses text buttons. Adding icons for tools would improve the UI.

3. **Fill Color Support**: The Polygon class supports fill color, but there's no UI for setting it. Adding a property dialog for polygons would allow users to set fill color and other properties.

4. **Snapping Improvements**: The current snapping to grid functionality is basic. Enhancing it to snap to existing points, lines, and other geometry objects would improve usability.

5. **Undo/Redo Support**: Adding undo/redo support for polygon creation (and other operations) would improve the user experience.

### Constraint System Implementation ✅

The constraint system has been successfully implemented:

1. **Constraint Framework**:
   - Implemented the Constraint interface in GExpertCore
   - Created a ConstraintManager to handle all constraints
   - Developed a ConstraintFactory for creating different types of constraints

2. **Constraint Types**:
   - Parallel Constraint: For keeping lines parallel
   - Perpendicular Constraint: For keeping lines perpendicular
   - Point On Line Constraint: For keeping points on lines
   - Point On Circle Constraint: For keeping points on circles
   - Equal Distance Constraint: For maintaining equal distances between points

3. **Constraint UI**:
   - Implemented a ConstraintTool for adding constraints
   - Added UI for selecting constraint types
   - Created visual feedback for active constraints

### Next Steps

1. **Implement Proof System (Task 9)**: The next major task is to implement the proof system, which will allow users to create and verify geometric proofs. This will require:
   - Porting the automated theorem proving functionality
   - Creating UI for displaying and interacting with proofs
   - Ensuring all proof-related features work correctly
   - Implementing proof step visualization

2. **Enhance Tool Interface**: Consider enhancing the Tool interface to include keyboard event handling methods, which would provide a more consistent approach for tools that need keyboard interaction (like the Text tool and Polygon tool).

## Conclusion

Porting JGEX to a web application using GWT is a significant undertaking that requires careful planning and implementation. By following the tasks outlined in this document, the port can be completed in a systematic and efficient manner, resulting in a fully-featured web application that maintains the functionality of the desktop version while adding web-specific features and benefits.
